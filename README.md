# BIRS-mini-project
A book issue and return system, created as a mini project for Java as a subject in Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering.
This was made with the help of group members Soham Dave and Shubham Patil. This project uses Swing and Java at front-end and MySQL 
as the database, with XAMPP being as the server used.
